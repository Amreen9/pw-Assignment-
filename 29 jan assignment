13. What are the benefits Of using Python?
Ans: 
    Easy to Learn and Use: Python is designed to be easy to learn and use, with a simple and consistent syntax. This makes it an ideal
                           language for beginners to learn programming.
    Large Standard Library: Python comes with a large standard library that provides many useful modules and functions, making it easy
                            to perform various tasks without the need for additional code.
    Cross-Platform: Python is a cross-platform language, which means that Python code can run on different operating systems, including 
                    Windows, macOS, and Linux.
    Open-Source and Free: Python is an open-source language, which means that the source code is available for anyone to use and modify.
                          It is also free to download and use.
    Strong Community Support: Python has a large and active community of developers who contribute to its development, create libraries, 
                              and offer support through forums, mailing lists, and other resources.
    Versatile: Python is a versatile language that can be used for a variety of applications, including web development, data analysis, 
               artificial intelligence, machine learning, scientific computing, and more.
    High Productivity: Python's easy-to-learn syntax, large library, and strong community support make it a highly productive language.
                       Developers can write code quickly and efficiently, resulting in faster development times and lower costs.
    Interpreted Language: Python is an interpreted language, which means that code can be executed directly without the need for compilation.
                          This makes development faster and more efficient.

14. How is memory managed in Python?
Ans: 
    Memory management in Python is handled automatically through a process called garbage collection. 
    Python uses a combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector to manage memory.
    Reference counting is a technique where Python keeps track of the number of references that point to each object. 
    When an object's reference count drops to zero, it is considered garbage and can be safely deleted.

15. How to install Python on Windows and set path variables?
Ans: 
   1 Download the latest version of Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   2 Run the installer and select "Add Python X.X to PATH" during the installation process.
   3 Choose the installation directory and click "Install".
   4 Once the installation is complete, open the "Command Prompt" or "PowerShell" and type "python" to check if Python is installed and working correctly.
   5 To set the path variables, right-click "This PC" and select "Properties".
   6 Click "Advanced System Settings" and then "Environment Variables".
   7 Under "System Variables", find "Path" and click "Edit".
   8 Click "New" and add the path of the Python installation directory (usually C:\PythonXX\ or C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Programs\PythonXX).
  10 Click "OK" on all windows and restart the Command Prompt or PowerShell.
  11 Type "python" in the Command Prompt or PowerShell to verify that the path variables are set correctly.

16. Is indentation required in python?
Ans: 
    Yes, indentation is required in Python. In fact, indentation plays a crucial role in determining the structure and flow of the code.
    Unlike other programming languages, Python uses indentation to mark blocks of code and to define scope.
