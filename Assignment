Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.
Ans:
      A database is a collection of data that is organized and stored in a way that allows for efficient retrieval
      and manipulation of that data. SQL and NoSQL are two types of databases that differ in their structure and
      query language. 
      
      The differences between SQL and NoSQL databases are summarized in the following table:
      1. SQL and NoSQL databases differ in their structure, query language, and scalability. 
      2. SQL databases are primarily called Relational Databases (RDBMS) and are table-based.
      3. whereas NoSQL databases are primarily called non-relational or distributed databases and can be document-based.
      4. key-value pairs, graph databases, or wide-column stores. SQL databases use Structured Query Language (SQL) to define and manipulate data.
      5. while NoSQL databases do not require a fixed schema and do not use SQL. SQL databases are vertically scalable.
      6. while NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.

Q2. What is DDL? Explain why CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE are used with an example.
Ans:
      1. DDL stands for Data Definition Language, which is a subset of SQL used to define and manage the structure of a database1234.
      2. DDL commands include CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE1234.
      3. CREATE is used to create a new table in SQL by specifying the table name, column names, and their data types13.
      4. DROP is used to remove an existing table along with its structure from the database124.
      5. ALTER is used to modify the structure of an existing table, such as adding or deleting columns124.
      6.TRUNCATE is used to remove all data from a table without deleting the table structure
example:
          # Create a new table
          conn.execute('''CREATE TABLE employees
                       (id INT PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
                       name TEXT NOT NULL,
                       age INT NOT NULL);''')
          # Add a new column to the table
          conn.execute('''ALTER TABLE employees
                       ADD COLUMN salary INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0;''')
          # Remove all data from the table
          conn.execute('''DELETE FROM employees;''')
          # Remove the table
          conn.execute('''DROP TABLE employees;''')
          # Commit the changes
          conn.commit()

          # Close the connection
          conn.close()

Q3. What is DML? Explain INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE with an example.
Ans:
      DML stands for Data Manipulation Language, which is a subset of SQL used to manipulate data in a database.
      DML commands include INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE. 
      Here are some examples of how these commands are used:
      INSERT: This command is used to insert new data into a table in SQL.
              For example, "INSERT INTO employees (id, name, age) VALUES (1, 'John', 30);
              will insert a new row into the "employees" table with the values "1" for "id", "John" for "name", and "30" for "age".
      UPDATE: This command is used to modify existing data in a table in SQL.
              For example, "UPDATE employees SET age = 35 WHERE id = 1;" will update the "age" column of the row with "id" equal to "1" in the "employees" table to "35".
      DELETE: This command is used to delete data from a table in SQL. 
              For example, "DELETE FROM employees WHERE id = 1;" will delete the row with "id" equal to "1" from the "employees" table.

Q4. What is DQL? Explain SELECT with an example.
Ans:
      DQL stands for Data Query Language, which is a subset of SQL used to retrieve data from a database. 
      The principal DQL command in SQL is the SELECT command, which retrieves data from one or more tables.
      Here is an example of how the SELECT command is used:
      SELECT * FROM employees;
       # Connect to the database
      conn = mysql.connector.connect('example.db')

      # Retrieve data from the table
      cursor = conn.execute("SELECT * FROM employees")

      # Print the data
      for row in cursor:
          print(row)

      # Close the connection
      conn.close()

Q5. Explain Primary Key and Foreign Key.
Ans:
        A primary key is a column or group of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each row in the table. 
        It is used to ensure data in the specific column is unique and cannot have NULL values.
        A foreign key is a column or group of columns in a table that provides a link between data in two tables.
        It is a column (or columns) that references a column (most often the primary key) of another table. 
        
    Here are some key differences between primary key and foreign key:
        1. A primary key uniquely identifies a row in a table, while a foreign key is used to link two tables together by referencing the primary key of one table from another table.
        2. A table can have only one primary key, while it can have multiple foreign keys.
        3. The primary key never accepts NULL values, whereas the foreign key may accept multiple NULL values.
        4. A primary key can be defined at the column or the table level, while a foreign key is always defined at the column level.
        5. By default, the primary key is a clustered index, and data in the database table is physically organized in the order of the clustered index. However, a foreign key is not a clustered index by default.

Q6. Write a python code to connect MySQL to python. Explain the cursor() and execute() method.
Ans:
          # Connect to the database
          conn = mysql.connector.connect(
            host="localhost",
            user="yourusername",
            password="yourpassword",
            database="yourdatabase"
          )

          # Create a cursor object
          cursor = conn.cursor()

          # Execute a SQL query
          cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM employees")

          # Fetch the result set
          result = cursor.fetchall()

          # Print the result set
          for row in result:
            print(row)

          # Close the connection
          conn.close()
 The cursor() method creates a cursor object that allows you to execute SQL queries and fetch the results.
 The execute() method is used to execute a SQL query, and it returns the number of rows affected by the query. 
 The fetchall() method is used to fetch all rows of the result set, and it returns a list of tuples.

Q7. Give the order of execution of SQL clauses in an SQL query.
Ans:
      -> The order of execution of SQL clauses in an SQL query is as follows:
      1. FROM and JOIN: The FROM clause and subsequent JOINs are first executed to determine the total working set of data that is being queried.
      2. HERE: The WHERE clause is used to filter the data based on specific conditions.
      3. GROUP BY: The GROUP BY clause is used to group the data based on one or more columns.
      4. HAVING: The HAVING clause is used to filter the data based on specific conditions after the GROUP BY clause has been applied.
      5. SELECT: The SELECT clause is used to select the columns that will be returned in the result set.
      6. DISTINCT: The DISTINCT clause is used to remove duplicates from the result set.
      7. ORDER BY: The ORDER BY clause is used to sort the result set based on one or more columns.
      8. LIMIT: The LIMIT clause is used to limit the number of rows returned in the result set.
